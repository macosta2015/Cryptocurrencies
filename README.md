# Unsupervised-Learning
Challenge 18


# Goal:
The Goal of this module is to use machine learning with unsupervised learning. This is way different from the supervised learning that we have been dealing with. 
Some of the newer technologies that we are going to look at are the K-means algorithm, clusters and PCA. 

In this case we are going to use unsupervised machine learning with cryptos. We want to group the cryptos to have them classified. 
Please note that as we are going to use unsupervised learning we really do not know what the output will be. The data will be clustered. 

We first will need to clean plenty of the data to simplify it as much as possible. From a business perspective, we will need to clean all the data that is unrelevant. 

In order to see our data results, we are going to graph the data.
